## Background
Turns out Twitter didn't actually delete the 2014 layout like they said they did. If you use an alternate useragent it works again!

## Installation

- Log out of twitter. (Sorry, it doesn't work while logged in)
- [Download it!](https://github.com/plece0/GoodTwitter-3-Chrome/releases)
- Create a new folder and place the zip contents into it
- Go to chrome://extensions
- Turn on developer mode
- Load unpacked...
- Select the downloaded file
- Accept everything it prompts you to
- Profit.

**Do not use this extension while logged in! It won't work and will constantly bug you about an "unsupported browser".**

## To-Do

- When you click on images, go to the t.co link instead of attempting to embed image.
- When you go to twitter.com immediately redirect to twitter.com/i/moments so that you don't have to see the login page everytime.
- Block the "unsupported browser" while logged in
- Add an option to use a 2014 theme (square pfp's, old retweet, like icon, etc,)
- Add an option for a dark theme
